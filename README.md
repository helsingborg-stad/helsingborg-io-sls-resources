# Serverless Framework (AWS)

## The concept

If you have a service that doesnâ€™t make sense to replicate in an ephemeral environment, we would suggest moving it to the repo with all the infrastructure services. This setup scales well as your project and team grows.

# Setup

## Requirements

- AWS CLI
- AWS Account
- AWS IAM user
- Homebrew (macOS)
- NodeJS
- NPM
- [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/)

### AWS CLI (Homebrew on macOS)

```
brew install awscli
```

### Create an AWS Account (Personal)

- [Create an account here](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start)

### Create an AWS IAM User

- Follow [this](https://serverless-stack.com/chapters/create-an-iam-user.html) guide

**Take a note of the Access key ID and Secret access key.**

### Add your access key for the IAM User to AWS CLI

It should look something like this:

- **Access key ID:** AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
- **Secret access key:** wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY

Simply run the following with your Secret Key ID and your Access Key.

You can leave the **Default region** name and **Default output** format the way they are.

```
aws configure
```

### Serverless Framework

The Serverless Framework helps you develop and deploy your AWS Lambda functions, along with the AWS infrastructure resources they require. It's a CLI that offers structure, automation and best practices out-of-the-box, allowing you to focus on building sophisticated, event-driven, serverless architectures, comprised of Functions and Events.

The Serverless Framework is different from other application frameworks because:

- It manages your code as well as your infrastructure
- It supports multiple languages (Node.js, Python, Java, and more)

```
npm install serverless -g
```

## Resources

### Environment variables (SSM)

```
git clone https://github.com/helsingborg/helsingborg-io-sls-resources

cd helsingborg-io-sls-resources/parameterStore

chmod +x ssmPutParameter.sh

./ssmPutParameter.sh
```

### Certificates (S3 Bucket)

```
cd ../certificates
sls deploy
```

**Take a note of the Bucket ID.**

### Database (DynamoDB)

```
cd ../database
sls deploy
```
